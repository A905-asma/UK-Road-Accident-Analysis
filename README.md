# UK-Road-Accident-Analysis
# 🚦 DriveSafe UK: Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (2012–2014)

## 📊 Overview

This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing UK road accidents from 2012 to 2014. It aims to uncover trends in accident frequency, severity, location, and contributing conditions (e.g., weather, road type), ultimately supporting smarter urban planning and road safety decisions.

🔗 **Dataset Source**: [UK Traffic Flow Data (2000–2016) on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales)  
📅 **Filtered Years**: 2012–2014  
📍 **Geography**: UK

## 🧠 Objectives

- Identify accident trends by time and season.
- Analyze contributing factors (weather, surface, road type).
- Visualize accident density by district and urban vs. rural areas.
- Propose actionable recommendations to reduce accidents.

## 💡 Insights

- Peak accidents occur in **autumn months**, especially October and November.
- **Evening hours** show higher accident rates due to rush hours and low visibility.
- **Single carriageways** have the highest accident share.
- **Wet and icy roads** significantly increase accident severity.
- **Urban areas** face more frequent accidents than rural zones.

## ✅ Recommendations

1. Promote vehicle checks before wet or cold seasons to prevent weather related incidents..
2. Prioritize road maintenance in autumn.
3. Launch awareness campaigns in high risk urban districts.
4. Regularly publish public reports to encourage road safety behavior.
